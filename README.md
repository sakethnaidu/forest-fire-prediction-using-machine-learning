# forest-fire-prediction-using-machine-learning

A forest fire prediction project using machine learning would involve collecting and analyzing data on various factors that contribute to the likelihood of a forest fire. These factors could include weather conditions, topography, vegetation type, and historical fire data. The data would then be used to train a machine learning model to identify patterns and make predictions about the risk of a fire occurring in a given area.
The model could be used for real-time predictions, for example, by incorporating live weather data, or for long-term predictions such as seasonal forecast.
The project could also include developing a system for monitoring and detecting fires as they occur, using techniques such as satellite imagery and drone-based thermal imaging. The system could then alert authorities and aid in the efficient deployment of fire-fighting resources. Additionally, the project may also consider integrating the predictions with a decision support system for efficient resource allocation and evacuation planning.
